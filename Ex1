PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the
following operations:
1.Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
2.Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3.Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4.Overloaded << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.

OUTPUT:
Complex no 1 is:1.2 + 2.2i
Enter complex no 2:
Enter real part of complex number 2: 1

Enter imaginary part of complex number 2: 2
Complex number 1 is :1.2 + 2.2i
Complex number 2 is :1 + 2i
Complex number 3 is :0 + 0i

Addition of two complex numbers is: 2.2 + 4.2i

Multiplication of two complex number is: -3.2 + 4.6i
